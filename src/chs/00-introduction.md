# Introduction

Welcome to the notes for the 2 day workshop on research software development
aimed at PhD students at Cardiff University's School of Mathematics.

Motivation for this course is described at this page:
[Motivation]({{root}}/extras/motivation/).

In this course we will cover:

- Basic use of the command line (an efficient way of talking to your computer);
- Best practice in writing computer code (we will use Python but the ideas are
  applicable to any language);
- Best practice in writing LaTeX (including things like how to structure your
  source files)
- Using version control (how to use software to avoid things like
  "thesis_final_final_v2.tex)

Some specific things about how the course will work:

1. Please ensure you have installed all necessary software.
2. Before we start please join the Slack channel (and say hello).
3. There should be a few instructors roaming during the course. If at any point
   you would like their attention: call out their name.
