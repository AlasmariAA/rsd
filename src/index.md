# Research software development

## WIP

### Description

A vital part of research is the use and development of software (computer code).
Having a sound expertise in modern programming best practices will better
prepare postgraduates for any potential future they choose to follow. This 2 day
workshop will cover the basics of best practice based on expertise from the
Sustainable Software Institute and Software Carpentry training. Upon completion
students will:

- Be aware of best practices in terms of programming strategies (illustrated via
  Python but applicable to any language).
- Be able to use git to version control code and github to work collaboratively
  with others.
- Be able to write basic automated tests for code to ensure code is fit for
  purpose.

### Schedule

#### Day 1

- Morning: introduction to Python and programming best practice (command line,
  modularization, self documentation, documentation)
- Afternoon: Version control (git and github)

#### Day 2

- Morning: automated testing of software
- Afternoon: basic LaTeX and a collaborative group project (students will work
  on a simple problem collaboratively bringing all the skills together)
